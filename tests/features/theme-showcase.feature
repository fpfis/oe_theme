Feature: Theme showcase
  In order to be able to showcase the theme and its features
  As a developer
  I want to make sure that I can setup a demo site.

  Scenario: The demo site header features placeholder blocks
    Given I am on the homepage
    Then I should see the "sites switcher" element in the "header"
    And I should see the "search box" element in the "header"
    And I should see the "language switcher" element in the "header"

  Scenario: The demo site navigation features placeholder menu links
    Given I am on the homepage
    Then I should see the following links in the "navigation" region:
      | About      |
      | Priorities |
      | Contacts   |
    And I should see the following links in the "priorities dropdown menu":
      | Democratic change              |
      | Digital single market          |
      | Energy union and climate       |
      | Internal market                |
      | Jobs, growth and investment    |
      | Justice and fundamental rights |
      | Migration                      |

    And I should see the following links in the "about dropdown menu":
      | Commission at work |
      | Departments        |

  Scenario: The demo site footer features placeholder blocks
    Given I am on the homepage
    Then I should see the "identity block" element in the "identity footer"
    And I should see the "corporate block" element in the "corporate footer"
    And I should see the "contacts block" element in the "contacts footer"
